//UI Requirements:

The starting screen should have a button that 
users can click to start the quiz.


Users should be prompted through a series of at least 
5 multiple choice questions which they can answer.


Users should be asked questions one after the other.


Users should only be prompted with one question at a time.


Users should be able to answer questions with the mouse or keyboard.


Users should not be able to skip questions.


Users should also be able to see which question they're on 
(for instance, "7 out of 10") and their current score 
("5 correct, 2 incorrect").


Upon submitting an answer, users should:

  1. receive textual feedback about their answer. 
      If they were incorrect, they should be told the correct answer.
  2 . be moved onto the next question (or interact with an element to move on).
  3. Users should be shown their overall score at the end of the quiz. 
      In other words, how many questions they got right out of the total questions asked.
  4. Users should be able to start a new game.

//Technical Requirements:

Render questions in a <form>.


Use other semantic HTML, along with CSS and jQuery.


Follow a11y best-practices.


Be fully usable by keyboard and mouse (which will be easy enough if you start with a form).
